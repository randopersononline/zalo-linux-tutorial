A quick tutorial on how to get the social media app Zalo working on Linux.

# using Bottles (recommended)
Setting up Zalo using Bottles is another option you can try. I recommend using Bottles as it more user friendly & easier to use.
   ###Step by step tutorial
   - [Download Zalo.exe](https://zalo.me/pc) (⚠️ You might need a chrome mask if your'e using firefox or firefox based browsers)
   - [Download Bottles](https://usebottles.com/)
   - Open Bottles, Click on the three dots button next to the search icon, navigate to preferences then click on runner & download the latest "Caffe" verison
   - Click on the plus button on the top left of the screen, choose "Custom" and choose "Caffe" as the runner
   - After the bottles is created, navigate to the "Programs" section in your Bottle and click on the "add shortcut"
   - Find the ZaloSetup.exe you downloaded and add it to Bottles and start the .exe file
   - After setting up, the Zalo.exe will show up in the "Programs" section
   - Done!

# using ports of Zalo (not recommended)
There is alot of ported versions of Mac Zalo to Linux, some of them are still updated to this day but some doesn't work. You can find them by searching "linux zalo" on the github search bar, these ported version doesn't have all of the key features that nomral Zalo have like calling or message syncing.

# webapp Zalo (not recommended)
Setting up an webapp is very simple & easy, some distros have webapp built for you to use the web version of Zalo. Although the setup is easy, it does come with limitations of the web verison of Zalo.
