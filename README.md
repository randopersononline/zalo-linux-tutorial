# zalo-linux-tutorial 🐧
A quick tutorial on how to get the social media app Zalo working on Linux.

# using Bottles (recommended)
Setting up Zalo using Bottles is another option you can try. I recommend using Bottles as it more user friendly & easier to use, i would also recommend "Windows 7" as the windows version and the "Caffe" as the runner.

# using ports of Zalo (not recommended)
There is alot of ported versions of Mac Zalo to Linux, some of them are still updated to this day but some doesn't work. You can find them by searching "linux zalo" on the github search bar, these ported version doesn't have all of the key features that nomral Zalo have like calling or message syncing.

# webapp Zalo (not recommended)
Setting up an webapp is very simple & easy, some distros have webapp built for you to use the web version of Zalo. Although the setup is easy, it does come with limitations of the web verison of Zalo.
