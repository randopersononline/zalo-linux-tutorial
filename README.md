# zalo-linux-tutorial
A quick tutorial on how to get the social media app Zalo working on Linux.

# using a ported version of Zalo
This version of Zalo was ported from Mac by realdtn2. Download tutorial [**here**](https://github.com/realdtn2/zalo-linux-unofficial-2024). 
   - Requires git & python
   - Can't call using this version
   - Can incounter bugs
   - Have both Vanilla Zalo & ZaloZaDark as an option

# using Wine/Bottles (recommended)
Setting up Zalo using Wine or Bottles is another option you can try. I recommend using Bottles as it more user friendly & easier to use, i would also recommend "Windows 7" as the windows version and the latest Wine GE or Proton GE as the runner.

# webapp Zalo (Not recommended)
Setting up an webapp is very simple & easy, some distros have webapp built for you to use the web version of Zalo. Although the setup is easy, it does come with limitations of the web verison of Zalo.
